**Paper Abstract:**

This paper aims to analyze the impact of infrastructure development on demographic indicators like infant mortality rate, child birth
rate and total fertility rate across different Indian states, using a large panel dataset encompassing all the Indian states from the year
2005-2015. We would be using Telephone Lines per 100, Village Electrification, and Road network lengths as the infrastructure
indicators to conduct our research. To achieve this, we will run a regression across different Indian states for the time period 2005 -
2015.
